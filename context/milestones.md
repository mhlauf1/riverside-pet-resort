# Milestones

## Overview

The Wags Stay N' Play website is built in milestones, not features. Each milestone represents a meaningful, deployable chunk of work. The site should be viewable on Vercel after every milestone.

Wags is a straightforward facility site with some unique features (cat services, assessment process, 4 kennel sizes). The milestone plan reflects the standard Embark build cadence.
